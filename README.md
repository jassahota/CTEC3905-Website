# CTEC3905 - Website 
This is a website that contains basic information about two different teams in three different sports including football, f1 & basketball.


## Navigation Bar
- The navigation bar includes the website name this is SportsGo, with the navigation links that are floated to the right with CSS.
and this is responsive so when the screen size goes lower than 520px 

- The navigation turns into a more mobile-friendly looking navigation bar and once the user clicks on the menu a drop down of all the links 
displays that would show up in a screen size above 520px. 

- The navigation is using a single page and will smooth scroll to the section that has been clicked e.g. football.


## Preloading SECTION 
- This displays at as soon as the website opens with an image with low opacity and then above that is a loading icon in red that spins underneath this 
represents that the website is loading to open, in the code, it is only done with CSS to give the illusion of loading. 

- With more time, the plan was to do it with JavaScript timer until everything has loaded up on the website.


## Intro Section
- The Intro section is a design created to make it simple for the user to know what will be contained on the website, a list of teams
that is within the centre of the section and slightly transparent container.

- Included with a slideshow created by CSS only that displays all stadiums in where they are located. 

- The list of teams is all href to go to the section they say they will such as what teams they are, this is done with the smooth scroll.


## Sports Section
- The sports section includes three images of the three sports used on the website, that are used as flip cards with the front side as the image 
and the back is information about the sport, this technique was incorporated form several other websites but used in a way that would make more sense to me.

- Underneath the images are a slideshow of quotes that would fade in from the left and fade out the right using CSS.


## Football, F1 & Basketball Sections

- The News within the section is using guardian API so once the user clicks on the button 3 main headlines relating to the sports display within
the container for news.

- The other 2 containers include brief information about the teams using a list 'ul & li' and below this is logos that have a hover effect once
the user hovers the mouse over the image than text displays with a description of the logo with an overlay that is transparent.

- Between each section is a 'Go to top' the user can click this section where the smooth scroll is used to scroll to the top of the website.


## Footer

- The footer includes the name of the person who created the website and below is a logo of GitHub and this a link that once hovered over will spin 360 
degrees also once clicked it will go to the users(Me) repositories. 


## User testing - Family member 

### Ease of Use

- Observing the user, it showed that the system was straightforward to use as everything looked like it was in place as the user expecting, 
such as the navigation the bar was used quite frequently and clicking the go-to top section to go to the top but was not used as frequent 
than just scrolling with the mouse.

- The logos hovering over was interesting as the user felt it was a good touch and easy to do as it was just hovering the mouse over the image, 
as well as well as the flip card at the top was easy to just hover over.

- The user looked like they understood what to do with the button, to just click it and it would show headlines and made a comment about how it was a 
nice touch made the website more engaging and attractive, but the list could look better as it is confusing to pull apart each headline.

- The bouncing arrow that is looking up makes it easier to know that the section is clickable for the user as they felt it gave guidance on what the 
function did.


### Interface

- The user felt the colour scheme used on the website was very good as it goes well together and flows throughout the website with the blue and grey 
concept.

- The text seems easy to read with the white and size of the text for the user was ok but could have been slightly larger as the user did complain 
about how the text was too together in a sense that it felt too crammed together.

- The text was complimented as there was a good use of the different text but they did not there was not an overuse of different text and them 
did not give a different feel once I asked the user testing the system.


### Overall views
- The overall view of the system was satisfactory as it provided sufficient information in a wide variety of ways there could have been some 
interaction with the system to make it more engaging where the user can do something like post a comment etc... 

- While the user was navigating around the system they felt it was natural and like other websites, in terms of it has a navigation bar that is easy to 
use along with the go to the top that made it a lot easier as it was an extra option than using the mouse scroll. 

- Good use of images was explained to me and the size was just about right as it gave a good idea of what the image was and represented the information 
that was presented or what the section was about rather than reading all the time.

- The slide show at the top was a good touch to the website as comments were made it stays at each image for a good amount of time to get a good idea of 
what is being displayed. 

- The text above the slide show was easy to read as the black box behind it made it simpler and especially liked the look of the quotes that 
faded in and out.


## Issues & Resolution
- 1. Issue: The first issue I was having while designing my website was attempting to keep the navigation bar fixed to the position, the mobile nav bar
kept causing issues for me and made a mess of my website by moving my content around.
- 1. Resolution: The resolution to this issue was by creating a go to top link between each section so it is easier for the user to go to the top without
using the mouse scroll.

- 2. Issue: An issue with the website was that the API was displaying 10 outputs but this was not wanted by myself as it was too much headlines from 
the Guardian API.
- 2. Resolution: I did some research on how Guardian API works and help from the lab session when we went through APIs I was able to figure out 
the different settings and how it works, I was able to only have 3 top headlines to display once clicking on the button.

- 3. Issue: I identified that their was not much going on in the website as their was only three sections that all looked kind the same, and did 
not bring any diversity within the website. 
- 3. Resolution: The solution for this was by adding an additional section this was dedicated only to the three sports with flip cards that brought
a different feel to the website and make it more engaging and interactive.
