# CTEC3905 - Website 
This is a website that contains basic information about two different teams in three different sports 
including football, f1 & basketball.

## Navigation Bar
- The navigation bar includes the website name this is SportsGo, with the navigation links are floated to the right with css
and this is reonsive so when the screen size goes lower than 520px 

- The navigaiton turns into a more mobile friendly looking navigation bar and once the user clicks on menu a drop down of all 
the links displays that would show up on a screen size above 520px. 

- The navigation is using a single page and will smooth scroll to the section that has been clicked e.g. football.

## Preloading SECTION 
- This displays at assoon as the website opens with a image with low opacity and then above that is a loding icon in red that spins underneath this 
represents that the website is loading to open, in the code it is only done with CSS to give the illusion of loading. 

- With more time the plan was to do it with javascript with timer untill everything has loaded up on the website.

## Intro Section
-The Intro section is a design created to make it simple of the user to know what will be contained within the website, a list of teams
that is within the center of the section and slightly transparent container.

- incldued with a slideshow created by css only that displays all stadiums in where they are located. 

- the list of teams are all href to go to the section they say they will such as what teams they are, this is done with smoothscroll.

## Sports Section
-The sports section includes three iages of the three sports used in the wbesite, that are used as flipcards with the front side as the image and the back
is informaiton about the sport, this technique was incorperated form several other websites but used in a way that would make more sense to myself.

- Underneath the images was a slideshow of qoutes that would fade in from the left and fade out the right using CSS.

## Football, F1 & Basketball Sections
- The News within the section is usinga  guardian API so once the user clicks on the button 3 main headlines relating to the sport display within
the container for news.

- The other 2 containers include breif informaiton about the teams using a list 'ul & li' and below this is logos that have a hover effect once
the user hovers mouse of the image then text displays with description of logo with an overlay that is transparent.

- Between each section is a 'Go to top' the user can click this section where smooth scroll is used to scroll to the top of the website.

## Footer
- The footer includes the name of the person who created the website and below is a logo of github and this a link that once hovered over will spin 360 degrees
also once clicked it will go to the users(Me) repositories.

## User testing - Family memeber 
 
### Ease of Use
- Observing the user it showed that the system was straight forward to use as everything looked like it was in place as the user expecting, such as the navigation 
bar was used quite frequently and clicking the go to top section to go to the top but was not used as frequent than just scrolling with the mouse.

- The logos hovering over was interesting as the user felt it was a good touch and easy to do as it was just hovering the mouse over the image, as well as well as the 
flip card at the top were easy to just hover over.

- The user looked like they understood what to do with the button, to just click it and it would show headlines and made a comment about how it was a nice touch 
made the website more engagiging and attractive, but the list could look better as it is confusing to pull apart each headline.

- the bouncing arrow that is looking up makes it easier to know that the section is clickable for the user as they felt it gave guidance on what the function did.

### Interface
- The user felt the color scheme used in the website was very good as it goes well together and flows throughout the website with the blue and grey concept.

- The text seem easy to read with the white and size of the text for the user was ok but could ahve been slightly larger as the user did complain about how the text was too 
togther in a sense that it felt too cramed together.

- The text was complimented as thre was a good use of the different text but they did not there was not an over use of different text and they 
did not give a different feel once I asked the user testing the system.

### Overall views
- The overall view of the system was satisfactory as it provided sufficent information in a wide variety of ways there could have been some interaction
with the system to make it more engaging where the user can do something like post a comment etc... 

- While the user was navigating around the system they felt it was natural and like other websites, in terms of it has a navigation bar that is easy to use along with 
the go to the top that made it a lot easier as it was an extra option than using the mouse scroller. 

- Good use of images were explained to myself and the size was just about right as it gave a good idea of wha tthe image was and represented the information that was presented
or what the section was about rather than reading all the time.

- The slideshow at the top was a good touch to the website as comments were made it stays at ech image for a good amount of time to get a good idea of what is being displayed. 
The the text above the slide show was easy to read as the black box behind it made it more simple and especially liked the look of the qoutes that faded in and out.
